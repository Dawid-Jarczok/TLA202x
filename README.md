For now only used with [TLA2024](https://www.ti.com/product/TLA2024), some function don't work with [TLA2022](https://www.ti.com/product/TLA2022) or [TLA2021](https://www.ti.com/product/TLA2021).\
Only TLA2024 have MUX.\
TLA2021 don't have PGA.\
Tested on ESP32, but should work on any arduino framework chips.
